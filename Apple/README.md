# Apple
This is where my career is currently: Managing Apple devices in enterprise environments.

I put things here that are mostly helpful to me (so I don't forget them) and hopefully useful to aMac Admins

## Community Resources
A while back, I wrote a blog about my experiences having a near-greenfield to implement an MDM solution at a previous org: [Evaluating Apple MDM Products | SysManSquad](https://sysmansquad.com/2022/05/03/2022-05-03-evaluating-apple-mdm-products).
From that, these tables were born:

### [MDM Comparison Table](Apple/MDM%20Comparison%20Table.md)
A big table comparing various MDM vendor features in an attempt to make it easier for others to see pros/cons of each

### [MDM Networking Requirements](Apple/MDM%20Networking%20Requirements.md)
This one started much later when it became necessary to track and manage a ton of URLs for an org with high security and a requirement to Allow List only what's needed.
This is definitely out of date, I have no automation skills with git/Github Actions. Sorry.

## [Jamf](Jamf)
Anything I'm able to publish that useful for Jamf Pro. Much of it can likely be modified to work with other MDMs with low-to-mid effort.
